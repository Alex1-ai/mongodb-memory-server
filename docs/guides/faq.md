### Do binaries get automatically deleted?

No, this package will **not** delete any binaries, so after an system upgrade the binaries may have to be cleaned manually

### Why is there no documentation about class-options / interfaces in the documentation?

It is recommended to directly look at the TSDoc for these properties to get their type & documentation
